# HuskyCI CLI Configuration File
# This is an example configuration file for the HuskyCI CLI tool.
# Copy this file to ~/.huskyci/config.yaml and customize it for your environment.
#
# The config file uses YAML format and supports multiple targets (HuskyCI API endpoints).
# You can switch between targets using the 'huskyci target-set' command.

targets:
  # Example: Local development environment
  local:
    current: false
    endpoint: "http://localhost:8888"
    token-storage: "keychain"  # Options: "keychain", "file", or leave empty for manual entry
  
  # Example: Production environment
  production:
    current: true
    endpoint: "https://huskyci-api.example.com"
    token-storage: "keychain"
  
  # Example: Staging environment
  staging:
    current: false
    endpoint: "https://staging-huskyci-api.example.com"
    token-storage: "keychain"

# Configuration Notes:
# - 'current': Set to 'true' for the active target, 'false' for others
# - 'endpoint': The full URL of your HuskyCI API server (including protocol and port)
# - 'token-storage': Optional field indicating where authentication tokens are stored
#   - "keychain": Store tokens in system keychain (macOS/Windows)
#   - "file": Store tokens in a file
#   - Leave empty or omit: Tokens will need to be entered manually or via environment variables
#
# You can also use environment variables instead of this config file:
# - HUSKYCI_CLIENT_API_ADDR: API endpoint URL
# - HUSKYCI_CLIENT_TOKEN: Authentication token
# - HUSKYCI_CLIENT_REPO_URL: Repository URL to analyze
# - HUSKYCI_CLIENT_REPO_BRANCH: Repository branch to analyze
